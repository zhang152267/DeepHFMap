# DeepHFMap
DeepHFMap is a deep learning method for predicting geothermal heat flow, and it maps heat flow with multiple geological features.

The code is being collated, and the code and data will be uploaded here later.

# Dependencies

Python 3.10

PyTorch = 2.41

# Dataset

heatflow: The primary heat flow measurements are sourced from http://heatflow.org/, supplemented by the database provided in  (Lucazeau, 2019), thereby building a more comprehensive data foundation. 

Geological Feature Data: The sources of geological feature data are shown in the following table
